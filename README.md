# Official release of the CeleryApp (UI) in C#

Let me know when you found the bitcoin miner, the malware, and the trojans.

This will reflect the latest/current release of Celery, to prove authenticity.
No, there is nothing hiding in the DLL either.

I encourage you to open Fiddler and see for yourself that it makes 0 requests
apart from the Celery settings file, which is a text file

If you think it's stealing cookies from reading a text file, I'm flabbergasted

# Compiling

You will need a bunch of VS packages to compile this properly.
They can all be installed or I will include those separately at another URL

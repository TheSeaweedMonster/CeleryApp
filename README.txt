# Official release of the CeleryApp (UI) in C#

Let me know when you found the bitcoin miner, the malware, and the trojans.

This will reflect the latest/current release of Celery, to prove authenticity.
No, there is nothing hiding in the DLL either.

I encourage you to open Fiddler and see for yourself that it makes 0 requests
apart from the Celery settings file, which is a text file on my GitHub.

If you think it's stealing cookies, I'm flabbergasted but I don't own GitHub

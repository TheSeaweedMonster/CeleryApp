# Official Release of the CeleryApp (UI) in C#

Let me know when you found the bitcoin miner, the malware, and the trojans. They're hiding all over the place.
That "bitcoin" string is probably somewhere in the monaco files btw.

This will reflect the latest/current release of Celery, to prove its authenticity.
No, there is nothing hiding in the DLL either.

I encourage you to open Fiddler and test that for yourself
